a.	Capture all TCP traffic to/from Facebook, during the time when you log in to your Facebook account 
-->   tcp && ip.addr == pc address && ip.addr== fb address

b.	Capture all HTTP traffic to/from Facebook (other website), when you log in to your Facebook account 
-->	http && ip.addr== pc ip address && ip.addr== sppu address

c.	Write a DISPLAY filter expression to count all TCP packets (captured under item #1) that have the flags SYN, PSH, and RST set. Show 	the fraction of packets that had each flag set. 
-->	tcp.flags.reset==1 && ip.addr== pc ip address && ip.addr== fb
	tcp.flags.syn==1 && ip.addr== pc ip address && ip.addr== fb
	tcp.flags.push==1 && ip.addr== pc ip address && ip.addr== fb

d.	Count how many TCP packets you received from / sent to Facebook (other website), and how many of each were also HTTP packets.
-->	http && tcp && ip.addr== pc id address && ip.addr== techpanda
